# Annual Statement Analyzer

This project is designed to analyse annual statements. It reads the pdf contents and builds a QnA RAG system that you can query.

# How does Composio help?

Composio gives the AI Agent the ability to create a RAG system and allows querying of this vector store. Everything from reading the pdf content to storing it in a vector store to querying is is performed autonomously by the AI Agent.

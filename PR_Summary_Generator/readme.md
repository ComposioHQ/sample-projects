## PR Summary Chatbot Assistant

This is a simple chatbot assistant built with OpenAI API & Composio then can help a user get summaries of the PRs created for a specific Github Repository.

As soon as a PR is created, the AI agent starts reading the changes and summarizes it and can send it to your Slack.

In production, Composio also has access to FileTool and each file change can be reviewed and even modified to fix any problems.
